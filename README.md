dimg_forced_timestamp works with the ERS (entity revision scheduling) to make the site look as if it’s in the future or past. Whatever revision of the content is set to publish or was published during that time will show as published to the user. For instance, if a content is set to go live on black friday, and you want to preview the site as if it’s black friday morning, you can set the timestamp, and view the site as if it is black friday. It provides a UI widget in the Admin toolbar in Drupal 7 to see the entity revisions for the entities on the page as well as a Date field for selecting a date in the future or the past.
